# Introduction for R package EQUAL
We develop an R package EQUAL which is for computing the precision matrix from a observation data. More details can be found in the following paper:

"Efficient admm algorithm via the QUAdratic Loss (EQUAL) for precision matrix estimation" [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04545)  

This is my first R package and welcome any comments or suggesiongs.

## Getting Started
These instructions will give you a toy example for implementing the package.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("Matrix")
install.packages("devtools")
```
### Install EQUAL

```
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cescwang85/EQUAL")
```

### Toy example for EQUAL

```
rm(list = ls())
set.seed(123)
library('MASS')
library('Rcpp')
library('Matrix')
library('EQUAL')
n=100
p=500
Omega<-toeplitz(0.5^(1:p-1))
X=mvrnorm(n,rep(0,p),solve(Omega))
aa<-EQUAL(X)
bb<-EQUAL(X,type=FALSE);

obj1<-CVEQUAL(X);
obj2<-CVEQUAL(X,type=FALSE)
obj1$Omega[1:10,1:10]
obj2$Omega[1:10,1:10]
```
On my computer, it takes about one second for a solution path and five seconds for getting a final estimation with 5-folds cross-validation for the above toy example. Overall, the computation complexity of the algorithm is linear in both the sample size(n) and the number of parameters (p^2).
